Data visualization project exploring the impact of socioeconomic, environmental, and urbanization factors on COVID-19 case trends, economic activity, and air quality across U.S. states. Visualized using Tableau.

# üìä COVID-19 Visual Insights Across the United States

This project investigates the complex relationship between socioeconomic, environmental, and urbanization factors and their influence on COVID-19 outcomes in the United States. Using rich datasets and powerful visualizations, we explore how variables like wage levels, population density, seasonal patterns, and work-from-home trends impacted COVID-19 case rates, sector-specific economic performance, and air quality across various regions.

## üìå Project Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, states across the U.S. experienced varied outcomes depending on their demographics, economic makeup, and urban development. Our goal was to visualize and interpret these patterns to uncover insights into how these factors shaped the spread and impact of the virus.

This project was completed as part of the **MIS 6380 - Data Visualization** course.

## üéØ Objectives

- Explore the influence of wage levels, employment trends, and population density on COVID-19 case rates.
- Visualize sector-specific impacts (e.g., travel & tourism) in high- vs. low-wage states.
- Compare seasonal COVID-19 surges and their geographic patterns.
- Examine the environmental effect of lockdowns on air quality across major metropolitan areas.
- Use data storytelling to present clear, actionable insights through Tableau dashboards.

## üß™ Hypotheses

### 1. **Wage vs. Travel Impact**  
   States with higher average wages experienced a larger decline in travel, tourism, and outdoor activity from 2019 to 2020 compared to lower-wage states.

### 2. **Population Density vs. COVID Transmission**  
   U.S. states with higher population density had increased transmission rates due to more frequent human interactions.

<br><br>


### 3. **Seasonal Case Patterns**  
   COVID-19 cases peaked during winter seasons (2020‚Äì2021) compared to summer seasons.

<br><br>


### 4. **Travel Restrictions at Airports**  
   Passenger traffic at San Francisco International Airport fell by 50% during 2020‚Äì2021, recovering gradually in 2022‚Äì2023 post-lockdowns.

### 5. **Air Quality Improvements**  
   Cities like New York observed up to 20% improvement in air quality during 2020, driven by reduced vehicle usage and remote work adoption.

## üìä Tools and Technologies Used

| Travel Statistics | San Francisco Airport / Public Airport APIs |
| COVID Case Tracking | [CSSEGISandData GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) |

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Merged diverse datasets using consistent geographic/state keys.
- Standardized date formats and normalized time series data.
- Performed pre-processing using Excel and Pandas.

## üí° Key Insights

- **Higher population density** states like New York and California showed a strong correlation with COVID-19 surges.
- **Travel and tourism** sectors in high-income regions experienced a sharper decline during the peak pandemic years.
- **Air quality metrics** in major cities improved significantly during 2020 due to reduced commuting.
- **Seasonal variation** showed winter peaks in cases, confirming global public health trends.
- **Work-from-home** rates influenced local emissions and indirectly affected urban air quality metrics.
