 From an epidemic to a pandemic 
The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11 2020. The term pandemic refers to multiple outbreaks of an infectious illness threatening multiple parts of the world at the same time. When the transmission is this widespread it can no longer be traced back to the country where it originated. After an initial relaxation of lockdown restrictions countries have reintroduced tighter rules as the number of cases worldwide continues to increase.



 The symptoms and those who are most at risk 
Most people who contract the virus will suffer only mild symptoms such as a cough a cold or a high temperature. However in more severe cases the infection can cause breathing difficulties and even pneumonia. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people but those at higher risk include older persons and people with pre-existing medical conditions including diabetes heart disease and lung disease. The vaccine rollout in the U.S. has started and the number of vaccinations administered had reached around 383 million doses as of September 16 2021.",,,,,

,,,,"In 2020 Washington D.C. had the highest population density in the United States with 11686 people per square mile. As a whole there were 93 residents per square mile in the U.S. and Alaska was the state with the lowest population density with 1.28 residents per square mile.



 The problem of population density 



Simply put population density is the population of a country divided by the area of the country. While this can be an interesting measure of how many people live in a country and how large the country is it does not account for the degree of urbanization  or the share of people who live in urban centers. 



For example Russia is the largest country in the world and has a comparatively low population so its population density is very low . However much of the country is uninhabited so cities in Russia are much more densely populated than the rest of the country.



 Urbanization in the United States 



While the United States is not very densely populated compared to other countries its population density has increased significantly over the past few decades. The degree of urbanization has also increased and well over half of the population lives in urban centers.

The WBI considers a combination of physical health, community activity, purpose, social health, and financial stability of a given state. The SDOHi considers healthcare access, food access, resource access, economic security, and access to housing and transportation in a given state.",,,,,,,
